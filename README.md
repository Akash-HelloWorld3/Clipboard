# Clipboard
Cut, copy, and paste files wherever you want, all from the comfort of your terminal! This is the ultimate clipboard system for the command line.

Clipboard...
- is **really tiny**. Clipboard rings in at mere tens of kilobytes for most platforms.
- is **really simple**. Clipboard takes no time to learn because there's nothing to learn.
- is **discoverable**. I never found out about other implementation of terminal clipboards because they were undiscoverable.
- **just works everywhere**. Clipboard has zero platform-specific code.
- **looks pretty**. Colors make everything nicer. ðŸŒˆ
- **saves time**. Stop making temporary directories or memorizing file locations!
