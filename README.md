Cut, copy, and paste absolutely anything anywhere you want, all from the comfort of your terminal! This is the missing clipboard system for the command line.

- **Zero-config:** Clipboard infers everything out of the box.
- **Zero-effort:** Clipboard is carefully designed to be friendly to newbies and power users alike.
- **Zero-dependency:** Clipboard works on any up-to-date Windows, Linux, Android, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD, or OpenIndiana system, or anything that supports C++20, all with ZERO dependencies. Yes, really!
- **Zero-legacy:** Clipboard carries zero (0) legacy baggage from the software of yore.
- **Universal:** Clipboard supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish locales.
- **A time-saver:** Clipboard frees you from ugly, temporary directories and memorizing file locations!

cb copy foo.txt launchcodes.doc

Examples:

```
cb cut bar.txt baz.docx
clipboard cut5 MyDirectory
cb cut69 bar.conf AnotherDirectory baz.txt

## Pipe In

## `CI`

Set this environment variable to make Clipboard overwrite existing items without a user prompt when pasting. This variable is intended for Continuous Integration scripts where a live human is not present to make decisions.

Set this environment variable to make Clipboard always show color regardless of what you set `NO_COLOR` to.

## `TMPDIR`

Set this environment variable to the directory that Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy.

## `NO_COLOR`

Set this environment variable to make Clipboard not show any colors.
