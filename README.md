# ðŸ“‹ Clipboard 
Cut, copy, and paste absolutely anything anywhere you want, all from the comfort of your terminal! This is the ultimate clipboard system for the command line.

**Clipboard...**
- **is really tiny**. We're serious about code size; Clipboard rings in at mere kilobytes on most platforms.
- **is really simple**. We're serious about scope; Clipboard is exactly that, a clipboard.
- **is really friendly**. We're serious about UX; Clipboard is zero-config and is carefully designed to be friendly to newbies and power users alike.
- **is really global**. We're serious about localization; Clipboard currently supports English, Spanish, and Portuguese locales.
- **"just works" everywhere**. We're serious about compatibility; Clipboard works on any Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD system, or anything that supports C++20, all with ZERO dependencies.
- **looks pretty**. We're serious about design; Clipboard has colorful text baked in everywhere.** ðŸŒˆ Say adiÃ³s to boring black & white!
- **saves time**. We're serious about productivity; Clipboard frees you from ugly, temporary directories and memorizing file locations!

**You can disable colors with the NO_COLOR environment variable.
