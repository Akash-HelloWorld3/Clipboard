# Clipboard
Cut, copy, and paste anything anywhere you want, all from the comfort of your terminal! The ultimate clipboard system for the command line.

Clipboard...
- **is really tiny**. Clipboard rings in at mere kilobytes for most platforms.
- **is really simple**. Clipboard takes no time to learn because there's nothing to learn.
- **is really discoverable**. I never found out about previous implementations of terminal clipboards because they were undiscoverable.
- **just works everywhere**. Clipboard works on any Windows or POSIX (Linux, macOS, *BSD) system.
- **looks pretty**. Colors make everything nicer. ðŸŒˆ Say sayonara to boring black & white!
- **saves time**. Stop making temporary directories or memorizing file locations!
