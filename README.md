# ðŸ“‹ Clipboard 
Cut, copy, and paste absolutely anything anywhere you want, all from the comfort of your terminal! This is the ultimate clipboard system for the command line.

- **zero-effort**. Clipboard is carefully designed to be friendly to newbies and power users alike.
- **zero-dependency**. Clipboard works on any up-to-date Windows, Linux, Android, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD, or OpenIndiana system, or anything that supports C++20, all with ZERO dependencies. Yes, really!
- **zero-legacy**. Clipboard carries zero (0) legacy baggage from the software of yore.
- **universal**. Clipboard supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish locales.
- **a time-saver**. Clipboard frees you from ugly, temporary directories and memorizing file locations!
